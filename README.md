Various bits and pieces, written either as components of a game or out of mere curiosity.

After the intro, select a sample from the listbox in the upper left corner and hit "Launch".

Most of the demos right now are just automatic. In "Nodes", you can drag the boxes themselves, drag lines
between the nodes, and break links between nodes. A few of the samples provide widgets that can be used to
change some settings. In "Timers", some of the output goes to the console, and what's happening is probably
less than obvious to someone not actually reading the code itself to see the flow.

"Game" is some bits from a game in progress. The "player" is the white dot, and can be controlled with the
buttons at the bottom, double-tapping a spot on the map, or with the cursor keys (in the simulator)... and
some devices on Android. A button also appears when you're over a warp or switch, in order to use that.
Currently, I only added a maze to be operated on by the switch.

Also, you can set some debug stuff in the Options screen, from the main menu, as well as wipe any persisent
state, namely any levels you've saved in the editor.

"Editor" is likewise part of an editor for the same game. There is a lot going on, and I haven't documented
much. Maybe later I'll describe how to use it. :P If by some chance you puzzle it out, you can hit "Test" to
try the level out (at a minimum, you must assign a starting cell in the "Player" view). An erroneous level
will be reported before you launch, via the console / message box. (Well, that's the ideal, anyway; the
machinery is all there for it.)
